# Comparison of AV1 and VVenC (Versatile Video Encoder)

[Aomenc GIT 12.10.2020 as AV1](https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/)

[VVenc 0.1.0.0 as VVC](https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/vvenc)
Disclamer

This is the first release of VVenC. A lot of functionality is not included/restricted and will of change in future updates.

This benchmark only covers the current state of VVenC in comparison to AV1 in 'natural' content, due to the current lack of some features for encoding 'screen' content. 'Natural' content is generated by the camera, containing live footage and doesn't have 'hard' edges as animation/gameplay/screen recording.

The current version of VVenC forces GOP size of 16, which means that it forced to create additional keyframes every 16 frames which greatly reduce encoding efficiency on long scenes.
